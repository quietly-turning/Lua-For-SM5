## Lua for SM5 â€“ GitHub Repository

This is the GitHub repository for my Lua for SM5 Guide and API doc.

### Viewing the Docs

A live instance of this site is hosted at: <https://quietly-turning.github.io/Lua-For-SM5/LuaAPI>

It's my hope the site can help you learn to script Lua in StepMania.

### Contributing to the Docs

If you'd like to contribute to this project, you'll need [node and
npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed on your
development machine.  This can typically be accomplished using the appropriate
package manager for your OS (e.g. `brew install node` for macOS).

After cloning this repository to your development machine, you'll need to
download the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
cd /path/to/Lua-For-SM5
npm ci
```

Once that's completed, you can start the local development environment using:

```bash
npm run start
```
