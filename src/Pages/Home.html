<h1>Lua for StepMania 5</h1>

<p>
	Hello there!  In these pages, you&apos;ll find my <strong>Lua for SM5</strong> guide, comprised of various chapters organized under the headers <span class="d-none d-md-inline d-lg-inline d-xl-inline">on the left</span> <span class="d-xl-none d-lg-none d-md-none">at the bottom</span> of this page.
</p>
<p>
	If you&apos;re unsure of where to start, check out the chapter on <a data-component="Link" href="/Introduction/Foreword">What Are Actors?</a> to get a sense of how Lua files are organized in StepMania 5.
</p>
<p>
	StepMania 5&apos;s complete Lua API documentation can be found in its Lua.xml file, which ships with releases of StepMania 5 in the <code>./Docs/Luadoc/</code> directory and can be viewed in most web browsers. I have also hosted a copy as part of this website: <a data-component="Link" href="/Lua-For-SM5/LuaAPI">Lua For SM5: Lua API</a>.

	You can find additional resources for learning about Lua and SM5 scripting on the <a data-component="Link" href="/Resources">Other Resources</a> page.
