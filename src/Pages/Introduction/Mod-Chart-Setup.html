<h1>Setting Up a "Mod" Chart</h1>
<p>
   StepMania simfiles can be scripted to enhance gameplay using Lua and the SM5 API. This chapter will briefly demonstrate how to prepare a simfile for such scripting.

   This chapter is a work-in-progress!

   The FGCHANGES field in your .sm file accepts several arguments delimited by equals signs. The first two are the most important:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>the beat in Gameplay at which you want the Lua file to be activated</li>
   <li>a path to the Lua file where you will be writing your code</li>
</ul>
<p>
   So, for exmaple, if you named your file <em>default.lua</em> and wanted it to trigger at beat 4, you would need to change your .sm (or .ssc) file to include:
</p>
<pre><code>#FGCHANGES: 4.000=./default.lua=1.000=0=0=1=====;</code></pre>
<p>
   The other arguments (the <code>1.000</code> and subsequent <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s) are <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm#bgchanges">various flags that are basically vestiges</a> from SM3.9 that are necessary to include but will have no impact on your Lua. For FGCHANGES, you can just copy/paste them into your .sm file for each FGCHANGE.
</p>
<p>
   Any Lua-based actors loaded as FGCHANGES will be cleared from the screen as soon as they are "done." This means that if the actor isn't actively <a data-component="Link" href="/Theming/Simple-Tweens">tweening</a> in some way, it will be cleared from memory.
</p>
<p>
   A common strategy is to ensure that this doesn't occur prematurely is to add a dummy keep-alive Actor that does nothing but sleep for as long as you want the overall Lua file to persist for. That might look like:
</p>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- a Lua file can only return one Actor
-- so the common strategy is to return one ActorFrame that contains many sub-Actors
return Def.ActorFrame{
   -- keep-alive Actor
   -- this will allow the file to persist for 999 seconds
   -- (or, until the end of the stepchart)
   Def.Actor{ OnCommand=function(self) self:sleep(999) end },

   -- the Sprite Actor
   Def.Sprite{
      Texture="awesome.png",
      OnCommand=function(self)
         self:Center():FullScreen():sleep(3):diffusealpha(0)
      end
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the example above, the the Sprite has a <code>sleep(3)</code> tween, so it would appear on the screen for 3 seconds at beat 4 (specified by the .sm file) and then have an alpha of <code>0</code> applied, causing it to be effectively invisible.
</p>
<p>
   If you are testing this in SM5's editor, you'll need to ensure that you have <strong>Show Background Changes</strong> enabled, otherwise neither BGChanges nor FGChanges will appear.
</p>
<p>
   SM5's Lua error reporting interface is invaluable when scripting things like this. You can toggle it on/off by holding <kbd>F3</kbd> and tapping <kbd>F6</kbd> then tapping <kbd>8</kbd>
</p>
<p>
   Finally, if there are no Lua errors, and you still can't get anything to appear, you may need to reload your simfiles.
