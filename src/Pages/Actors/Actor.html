<h1>Actor</h1>

<p>
   The <strong>Actor</strong> class is the most generic and lightweight StepMania Actor; all other Actors inherit from it (directly or eventually). Using an Actor object directly is not generally helpful; it can't <em>do</em> very much. The <code>LoadActor()</code> helper function <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/LoadActor">discussed later</a> is far more flexible and useful!
</p>

<p>
   Still, there are times when <strong>Actor</strong> objects can be useful. For example, the Simply Love SM5 port uses them when we need a hook into some message broadcast by the engine but don't need an entire ActorFrame.
</p>

<p>
   In theming example below, we are using an <code>Actor</code> to listen for the <code>StartTransitioningCommand</code> to be broadcast by the engine when a screen is transitioning out (and preparing to initialize the next screen). When that occurs, we make a call to save the theme's preferences, assuming the theme is already using the <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/5_1-new/Themes/_fallback/Scripts/02%20ThemePrefs.lua">ThemePrefs system</a>.
</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Example using an Actor directly:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
return Def.Actor{
   StartTransitioningCommand=function(self)
      ThemePrefs.Save()
   end
}
</code></pre>
