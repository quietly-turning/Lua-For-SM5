<h1>Actor</h1>
<p>The <strong>Actor</strong> class is the most generic and lightweight StepMania Actor; all other Actors inherit from it (directly or eventually). Using an Actor object directly is not generally helpful; it can&apos;t <em>do</em> very much.   The <code>LoadActor()</code> helper function <a data-component="Link" href="LoadActor">discussed later</a> is far more flexible and useful!</p>

<p>Still, there are times when <strong>Actor</strong> objects can be useful.  For example, the Simply Love SM5 port uses them when we need a hook into some message broadcast by the engine but don&apos;t need an entire ActorFrame.</p>

<p>In theming example below, we are using an <code>Actor</code> to listen for the <code>StartTransitioningCommand</code> to be broadcast by the engine when a screen is transitioning out (and preparing to initialize the next screen).  When that occurs, we make a call to save the theme&apos;s preferences, assuming the theme is already using the <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/5_1-new/Themes/_fallback/Scripts/02%20ThemePrefs.lua">ThemePrefs system</a>.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Example using an Actor directly:</span>

<pre><code class="lua">
return Def.Actor{
   StartTransitioningCommand=function(self)
      ThemePrefs.Save()
   end
}
</code></pre>
