<h1>ActorFrameTexture</h1>

<p><em>ActorFrameTexture</em> actors can be used to take what would otherwise be an ActorFrame of children Sprites, BitmapTexts, etc., and render them directly to a unique texture that can be loaded into a single Sprite actor.  At that point, the original ActorFrameTexture can be cut out of the render pipeline with a <code>visible(false)</code> command, and StepMania will have that many fewer actors to process every draw cycle.</p>

<p>This is a more abstract and advanced topic, but it can help cut down on the overhead of having StepMania keep track of many, many actors where a single sprite might suffice.</p>
