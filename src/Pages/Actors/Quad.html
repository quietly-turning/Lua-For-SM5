<h1>Quad</h1>

<p><em>Quad</em> actors are programmatically drawn <em>quad</em>rilaterals that can have properties like size, position, and color.  If you don&apos;t specify, Quad actors are white and have a height and width of 0 by default.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">A very simple Quad example:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- a white quad with height and width of 100px
Def.Quad{
   Name="WhiteQuad",
   InitCommand=function(self)
      self:zoomto(100,100)
   end
}
</code></pre>

<p>A common question that people new to StepMania scripting have is:</p>

<p><strong>Where are those commands like</strong> <code>zoomto()</code> <strong>coming from?</strong></p>

<p>Keeping in mind that a <em>Quad</em> is a specific type of StepMania <em>Actor</em>, we can look to StepMania&apos;s Lua API for a complete list of methods available to all <a data-component="Link" href="/LuaAPI#Actors-Actor">Actor objects</a>.</p>

<h2>A More Advanced Example</h2>

<p>Since Quads are fairly simple, let&apos;s use another example to animate some Quads.  This example makes use of a new-to-SM5 feature, command-chaining, which is discussed more in-depth in the Command Chaining section.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Three Quads with animation:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- let's assume this file is being called via FGCHANGES from a simfile.
-- Like in SM3.95, Actors from FGCHANGES that are not actively tweening
-- are cleared from memory as the engine assumes they are "done."
-- To counteract this, we'll apply a sleep() tween to the parent ActorFrame

return Def.ActorFrame{
   -- the OnCommand here applies to the primary ActorFrame
   OnCommand=function(self)
      self:sleep(9999)
   end,

   -- a red quad that accelerates from offscreen-left to offscreen-right
   -- this makes use of the _screen and Color aliases
   Def.Quad{
      Name="RedQuad",
      InitCommand=function(self)
         self:zoomto(100,100):diffuse(Color.Red)
      end,
      OnCommand=function(self)
         self:xy( -100, _screen.cy )
             :accelerate( 2 ):x( _screen.w + 100 )
      end
   },

   -- a blue quad that decelerates from offscreen-top to offscreen-bottom
   -- this makes use of the xy() command, which is new to SM5
   -- as well as command-chaining (read more on the next page!)
   Def.Quad{
      Name="BlueQuad",
      InitCommand=function(self)
         self:zoomto( 100, 100 ):diffuse( Color.Blue )
      end,
      OnCommand=function(self)
         self:xy( _screen.cx, -100)
             :decelerate( 2 ):y( _screen.h + 100 )
             :queuecommand( "TriggerSpin" )
      end,
      TriggerSpinCommand=function(self)
         local greenquad_af = self:GetParent():GetChild( "GreenQuadAF" )
         greenquad_af:GetChild( "GreenQuad" ):queuecommand( "Grow" )
      end
   },

   -- a green quad that waits for the two quads above to finish tweening,
   -- then grows out of the center of the screen while spinning

   -- NOTE: We can't apply tween-based commands and actor effects like spin()
   -- simultaneously.
   -- zoomto() will override spin() for the duration of its linear tween.
   -- The way to achive the effect of spinning toward the viewer is to
   -- wrap the Quad in an ActorFrame, spin the ActorFrame, and zoom the Quad.
   Def.ActorFrame{
      Name="GreenQuadAF",
      InitCommand=function(self)
         self:Center()
             :spin():effectmagnitude(0,0,180)
      end,

      Def.Quad{
         Name="GreenQuad",
         InitCommand=function(self)
            self:zoomto(0,0):diffuse(Color.Green)
         end,
         GrowCommand=function(self)
            self:linear(5):zoomto(_screen.w, _screen.h)
         end,
      }
   }

<h2>The <em>_fallback</em> theme has some helpful aliases.</h2>

<p>This example also uses a few helper tables defined in SM5&apos;s <em>_fallback</em> theme such as the <code>Color</code> table from <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/master/Themes/_fallback/Scripts/02%20Colors.lua">02 Colors.lua</a>  and the <code>_screen</code> table from <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/master/Themes/_fallback/Scripts/01%20alias.lua">01 alias.lua</a>.</p>
