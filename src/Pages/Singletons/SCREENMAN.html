<h1>SCREENMAN Singleton</h1>

<p>The SCREENMAN (short for <em>Screen Manager</em>) singleton is primarily used in conjunction with its <code>GetTopScreen()</code> method to do just that – get the screen that is currently on the top of StepMania&apos;s screen stack.  (This typically means the current screen.)</p>

<p>SCREENMAN also has a some other methods which are worth knowing, namely <code>SystemMessage()</code>.   As we&apos;ll demonstrate in <a href="/Debugging">the chapter on Debugging</a>, <code>SystemMessage()</code>  can be handy for quick debugging.</p>

<h3>GetTopScreen()</h3>

<p>Within the context of theming and simfile scripting, calling <code>SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()</code> will return the screen currently being displayed in the form of a <em>screen</em> object.
 For example, calling it on ScreenGameplay will get you the gameplay screen in the form of a screen object.  Calling it on ScreenPlayerOptions wil do similarly but return the player options screen.</p>

<p>While there are some methods available to <em>all</em> <a href="/LuaAPI#Actors-Screen">screen objects</a> (like <code>AddInputCallback()</code> which is covered in <a href="/Arbitrary-Input">Handling Arbitrary Input</a>), there are many more that depend on the class of the current Screen.
 A screen object of class <em>ScreenGameplay</em> will have the method <code>GetLifeMeter()</code> which returns a <a href="/LuaAPI#Actors-LifeMeter">LifeMeter</a> object.
 A screen object of class <em>ScreenSelectMusic</em> will have the method <code>GetMusicWheel()</code> which returns a <a href="/LuaAPI#Actors-MusicWheel">MusicWheel</a> ojbect.</p>

<p>Here is a small example that uses <code>GetTopScreen()</code> on ScreenSelectMusic to get a Lua reference to the MusicWheel and change the current sort of that MusicWheel.  In order for this code to work, it must be called from a theme&apos;s ScreenSelectMusic.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen() to get ScreenSelectMusic</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
return Actor{
   -- InitCommand happens before the screen we want is the TopScreen,
   -- so calling GetTopScreen() during an InitCommand would fetch the
   -- screen being transitioned out of that is about to be destroyed.
   -- It WILL be ready by the time OnCommand is called, however.

   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- Since this Lua is being called on ScreenSelectMusic
      -- the topscreen variable will be a screen object of ScreenSelectMusic.
      local topscreen = SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()

      -- Get a Lua reference to the engine's MusicWheel
      -- This is a Lua object of type "MusicWheel"
      local MusicWheel = topscreen:GetMusicWheel()

      -- Change the current sort of the MusicWheel.
      -- Fot a full list of available sorts, check the SortOrder enum
      -- as documented in the Lua API.
      MusicWheel:ChangeSort("SortOrder_Artist")
   end
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, there are many custom methods that belong to the many different classes of screens, more than can be reasonably documented here.  For a full list, please refer to the various screen classes documented in the <a href="/LuaAPI">SM5 Lua API</a>.  This currently includes everything from <strong>Class Screen</strong>:<em>ActorFrame</em> down to <strong>Class ScreenWithMenuElementsSimple</strong>:<em>ScreenWithMenuElements</em> (with the exception of ScreenManager itself, of course!).</p>
