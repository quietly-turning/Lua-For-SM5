      Animate things from one state to another
   </h2>
   <p>
      A <em>tween</em> is a process in computer animation in which an object is manipulated (translated, transformed, altered, etc.) from a starting state to an ending state. In the context of StepMania scripting, tweens are used to visually animate Actors.
   </p>
   <p>
      Using StepMania's Lua API, you can use tweens for many tasks, including (but not limited to):
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>make a <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/Sprite">Sprite Actor</a> grow to be twice as large by tweening <code>zoom(2)</code>
      </li>
      <li>make the entire Screen Actor appear to “fade out” by tweening <code>diffuse(0,0,0,0)</code>
      </li>
      <li>gradually make a <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/BitmapText">BitmapText Actor</a> by tweening <code>diffusealpha(0)</code>
      </li>
      <li>move a <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/Quad">Quad Actor</a> diagonally 100 pixels down and 100 pixels right by tweening <code>xy(100,100)</code>
      </li>
      <li>etc.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      This tutorial lists the types of simple tweens available through the <a data-component="Link" href="/LuaAPI">Lua API</a>, discusses how to use tweens, and concludes with a full example.

   <h2>
      Tweens Defined by the Engine
   </h2>
   <p>
      The StepMania engine defines four simple tweens directly: <em>linear</em>, <em>accelerate</em>, <em>decelerate</em>, and <em>spring</em>.
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <code>linear()</code> - Execute following commands steadily, at a constant rate.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>accelerate()</code> - Starts slow and progressively speeds up.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>decelerate()</code> - Starts fast and progressively slows down.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>spring()</code> - Rapidly shoots beyond the desired end state, then springs back into place.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      For completion's sake, it is worth noting here that <code>sleep()</code> is also a tween, even though most Lua scripters working with StepMania don't think of it as such. <code>sleep()</code> will wait for the specified duration, then execute all following commands at once.
   </p>
   <h2>
      Tweens Defined by the <em>_fallback</em> theme
   </h2>
   <p>
      The engine also defines a fifth tween type, <em>bezier</em>, which allows scripters to custom define more complex tweens. Indeed, the <em>_fallback</em> theme uses the <code>bezier()</code> tween type to predefine a few extra tweens for us that are simple to use.
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <code>smooth()</code> - Slow to start, fast in the middle, slow to finish.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>bouncebegin()</code> - Briefly inverts the tween at first, giving the appearance of bouncing to start.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>bounceend()</code> - Briefly inverts the tween at the end, giving the appearance of bouncing to end.
      </li>
      <li>
         <code>drop()</code> - Slows as it approaches its end state, then briefly accelerates the final few frames.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      If you are interested in learning more about <code>bezier()</code> tweens, you can inspect <strong><a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/master/Themes/_fallback/Scripts/02%20Actor.lua">02 Actor.lua</a></strong> in the _fallback theme's Scripts directory to see how <em>smooth</em>, <em>bouncebegin</em>, <em>bounceend</em>, and <em>drop</em> are defined in Lua.

   <h2>
      How to Use Tweens
   </h2>
   <p>
      Knowing <em>what</em> we can use is great, but it's only half the picture. If you apply a tween to an Actor without any further commands, it won't <em>do</em> anything. Tweens need additional commands to execute over the course of their duration in order to animate in any meaningful way.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each of the tweens listed above takes a single argument: a <em>number</em> representing a duration in seconds for long the StepMania engine should tween the methods that immediately follow for.
   </p>
   <p>
      Let's illustrate what we mean by this with some examples.
   </p><span class="CodeExample-Title">Tween a quad to become twice as large:</span>
   <pre><code class="lua">
Def.Quad{
   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- draw a Quad in center of the screen, make it 100x100 pixels,
      -- and make it red
      self:Center():zoomto(100,100):diffuse(1,0,0,1)

      -- over a duration of 3 seconds, have the
      -- quad zoom to be twice its initial size
      self:linear(3):zoom(2)
   end
}
</code></pre>
   <p>
      The next example is somewhat more fun in that it appears to spin the entire screen around, but it also illustrates a “gotcha” with tweening that you should be aware of.
   </p><span class="CodeExample-Title">Rotate the entire Screen on the z-axis:</span>
   <pre><code class="lua">
Def.Actor{
   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- get the current Screen object using SCREENMAN
      local screen = SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()

      -- over a duration of 2 seconds, have
      -- the entire screen rotate 360 degrees
      -- clockwise on the z-axis
      screen:accelerate(2):rotationz(360)

      -- wait one second
      screen:sleep(1)

      -- This should spin the screen around again, right?
      -- Not quite. The screen's z-rotation is already set
      -- to 360, so this will have no visible effect.
      screen:accelerate(2):rotationz(360)

      -- This, however, will because it adds more rotation
      -- to the current state, rather than the initial state.
      screen:accelerate(2):addrotationz(360)
   end
}
</code></pre>
   <p>
      Can you tween more than one property of an actor at once? Absolutely.
   </p>
   <p>
      The next example demonstrates that it is possible to tween multiple methods with a single tween. After calling a tween method, all methods following it will be tweened until the next tween method is encountered.
   </p><span class="CodeExample-Title">Move a quad across the screen while fading it out:</span>
   <pre><code class="lua">
Def.Quad{
   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- draw a Quad at the top-left of the screen, which is the
      -- default draw position if no x or y coordinates are specified,
      -- and make it 100x100 pixels
      self:zoomto(100,100)

      -- over a duration of 2 seconds, have the
      -- quad move to the bottom-right of the screen,
      -- and fade out by tweening the alpha channel to 0
      -- This comprises one full tween.
      self:decelerate(2):xy( _screen.w, _screen.h ):diffusealpha(0)

      -- Here is a second, unique tween that tweens three methods
      -- to change the color, xy-position, and y-rotation of the Quad.
      -- Note that line breaks are fine.
      self:accelerate(3)
          :diffuse(1,0,0,1)
          :xy( _screen.cx, _screen.cy )
          :addrotationy(1080)
   end
}
</code></pre>

      Reading about tweens good, but a visual is worth a thousand words. Here is a scripted simfile you can run in StepMania 5 that briefly demonstrates each of these tweens, one after another.
