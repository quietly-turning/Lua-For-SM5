<h1>Handling Arbitrary Input</h1>

<p>Arbitrary input (from game buttons, menu buttons, coin buttons, etc.) can be detected and handled by using the <code>AddInputCallback()</code> method of any screen.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">A very simple InputCallback example:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
local function InputHandler( event )
   -- do stuff with the event table in here
   -- the attributes of the event table are documented below
end

Def.ActorFrame{
   OnCommand=function(self)
      SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():AddInputCallback( InputHandler )
   end,
}
</code></pre>

<p>This adds the lua function <code>InputHandler()</code> to the list of functions the screen will pass input to.  Whenever an input event occurs, <code>InputHandler()</code> will be passed a table with the details of the event.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
   Note that <code>AddInputCallback</code> should <strong>not</strong> be used to capture
   text input from the user because it would not handle localization or different keyboard
   layouts.  Use <a data-component="Link" href="/LuaAPI#Screens-ScreenTextEntry">ScreenTextEntry</a>
   for that.
</p>

<p>The screen and your own callback function will both be passed input events, so be aware of what input the current screen responds to and consider the effects.</p>

<p>Details of the table containing the event data is as follows.  In the very simple example above, this table would be the <code>event</code> table that is passed into the <code>InputHandler()</code> function on <em>every</em> input event.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">An input event table:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
{
   -- The semi-raw button that was pressed.
   -- This is what the button was mapped to by
   -- the keymap settings, but without the
   -- conversions that occur when
   -- OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons is true.
   -- Will be empty if the button was not mapped.
   button = string,

   -- The type of event.  One of three possible values:
   --		"InputEventType_FirstPress"
   --		"InputEventType_Repeat"
   --		"InputEventType_Release".
   type = string,

   -- The cooked button that was pressed.
   -- This is button with mapping that occurs when
   -- OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons is true applied.
   -- This is nil for unmapped buttons.
   GameButton = string,

   -- The player that the controller is mapped to, or nil.

   -- "GameController_1" or "GameController_2"
   -- or nil if the event wasn't mapped to either controller.

   -- The raw details of the event.
   -- Most of the time, this will be "lower level"
   -- than anything you might want themeside.
   DeviceInput = {

      -- The type of device.  The first half of the string will be "Device_",
      -- the second half will be from InputDeviceNames in RageInputDevice.cpp.
      device = string,

      -- The button that was pressed. the first half of the string will
      -- be "DeviceButton_", the second half will be from InitNames
      -- in RageInputDevice.cpp.
      button= string,

      -- A floating point value for analog input, (ie. mouse)
      level = float,

      -- Mousewheel input.
      z = float,

      -- Whether the button is down.
      -- This is level with a threshold and debouncing applied.
      down = bool,

      -- How long ago this input occurred, in seconds.
      ago = float,

      -- True if the device is a joystick.
      is_joystick = bool,

      -- True if the device is a mouse.
      is_mouse = bool
   },

   -- Unknown purpose.  Probably related to Netplay.
   MultiPlayer = string,

<p>Here is a well-commented example, courtesy of Kyzentun.   It consists of a few variables, an input handling function, and an ActorFrame with two BitmapText actors whose text will be set by the input handling function.</p>

<p>Note that this example only displays information from the <em>most recent</em> button press because new input events (first_press, repeat, release) are triggered on a per-button basis.   It is possible to maintain a list of which buttons are being held in a Lua table, but this is left as an exercise for the reader for now. :)</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">A more practical Input Callback example:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- button_text and game_button_text will be set to actors when those actors
-- are created. These local variables exist to skip the hassle of calling
-- GetChild().
local button_text = false
local game_button_text = false

-- button_text will be used to show the button field from the input event,
-- and game_button_text will be used for the GameButton field.	These two
-- fields can be different because Stepmania has the OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons
-- preference.	That preference is intended to make it so that only the menu
-- buttons (MenuLeft, MenuRight, MenuUp, MenuDown, commonly only MenuLeft and
-- MenuRight on cabinets) can be used in menus.	 If OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons
-- is false, then Left will be translated to MenuLeft, and the GameButton
-- field will be set to MenuLeft when Left on the pad is pressed.
-- This digression about menu button translation really only matters to
-- themers trying to make a good menu control scheme.	For a simfile played
-- on a cabinet, GameButton will usually be nil, because most cabinets are
-- set not to map the pads to the menu buttons.

-- Since both text actors will have their text formatted the same way, it's
-- useful to make a wrapper function to avoid duplicating the formatting.
-- When the formatting changes, say changing spaces to colons, only
-- set_button_text needs to change.
local function set_button_text(text_actor, pn, button, press_type)
   text_actor:settext( ToEnumShortString(pn) .. " " .. button .. " " .. press_type )
end

-- Lua.xml lists all the parts of the event table.
local function InputHandler( event )
   -- If a button that is not mapped to any player is pressed, the
   -- PlayerNumber field will be nil.	Otherwise, it will be PLAYER_1 or
   -- PLAYER_2.
   if not event.PlayerNumber then return end
   -- The delay between FirstPress and Repeat is set by the RepeatDelay
   -- metric for the screen.
   -- The number of repeats per second is set by the RepeatRate metric.
