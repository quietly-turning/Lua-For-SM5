<h1>Keyboard Commands</h1>

<p>
   The StepMania engine provides some keyboard commands specifically to help
   creators.  Unless otherwise noted, these are globally available — they can
   be used at any time from any screen.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
   <strong>a note on Apple Keyboards</strong><br>
   If you're using an Apple keyboard on macOS (for example, the built-in keyboard
   on a MacBook), any commands that use <em>function</em> keys need to be
   also be combined with the <kbd>fn</kbd> key.<br><br>

   For example, to reload <em>metrics.ini</em> on Windows, Linux, or macOS-with-a-non-Apple-keyboard,
   you'd use <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>F2</kbd>, but on macOS with an Apple keyboard, you'd use
   <kbd>fn</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>F2</kbd>

<h2 id="reload-current-screen">Reload the Current Screen</h2>
<p>
   First, hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>F6</kbd> to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into <em>Theme</em> debug mode.<br>
   Then hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>2</kbd> to reload the current screen.
</p>

<p>
   You'll only need to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into <em>Theme</em> mode once.  Once that's
   set, you can directly use <kbd>F3</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> to reload the screen.
</p>

 </p>

<p>
   When creating content for StepMania, you'll frequently make a change to Lua and then want to
   see how it looks in your theme.  For example, a png graphic displayed with
   <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/LoadActor">LoadActor</a> might appear on-screen too small,
   and you want to try changing its <a data-component="Link" href="/LuaAPI#Actors-Actor-zoom">zoom</a>
   from <code>1</code> to <code>1.5</code>
</p>
<p>
   To see if <code>zoom(1.5)</code> is the amount you want, you'll need to:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>edit your Lua file</li>
   <li>save your Lua file</li>
   <li>reload the screen with <kbd>F3</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd></li>
</ol>

<p>
   When the StepMania engine "reloads the screen," it reads the Lua files for that screen from disk.
   Any changes you just made will be picked up, and you'll see your new code take effect.
</p>

<p>
   <strong>This workflow of <em>edit → save → reload</em> is the most common
   one you'll use in StepMania theming.</strong>  You'll change some code and reload
   the screen to test it.  Change some code, reload the screen.  Repeat.  Repeat.
</p>

<p>
   Eventually, you'll get your code where you want, and can stop reloading the screen until
   you start the next task.
</p>

<p>
   If you theme long enough, you'll develop muscle memory for <kbd>F3</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> and invoke
   it without thinking.  Eventually you'll try to use it on something unrelated like your Twitter feed,
   and momentarily wonder why it isn't working, and that will be your cue to take a break from
   StepMania theming.

<h2 id="reload-metrics">Reload Metrics.ini</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and tap <kbd>F2</kbd> reload the current theme's metrics.ini.
</p>

<p>
   Some theme functionality is controlled by its metrics.ini file.  For example, if you use the MusicWheel supplied
   by the StepMania engine, you will set whether to show a dedicated MusicWheelItem for "Random" and separately for
   "Roulette" in your theme's metrics.ini under the <code>[MusicWheel]</code> section.
</p>

<p>
   This code comes from SM5's default theme's
   <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/blob/d55acb1ba26f/Themes/default/metrics.ini#L838-L839">
      metrics.ini
   </a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="ini">[MusicWheel]
ShowRoulette=true
ShowRandom=true
</code></pre>

<p>
 If you want your theme to show a MusicWheelItem for Random but not Roulette, you'd change this to:
</p>

<pre><code class="ini">[MusicWheel]
ShowRoulette=false
ShowRandom=true
</code></pre>

<p>
   After saving changes to your theme's metrics.ini file, you'll need to:
</p>

<ol>
   <li>reload metrics.ini with <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>F2</kbd> so the engine loads your changes</li>
   <li><a href="#reload-current-screen">reload the current screen</a> with <kbd>F3</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> so you see your changes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reload-scripts">Reload <em>Scripts</em> Folder</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>control</kbd> and tap <kbd>F2</kbd> reload the current theme's <em>Scripts</em>
   folder.
</p>

<p>
   Since current Theming Best Practices™ suggest a theme's global variables and data structures should be
   defined and initialized in a file from <em>Scripts</em>, reloading your theme's <em>Scripts</em> folder
   can have the side effect of resetting a theme's working data.  Since most screens also make assumptions about
   working data, reloading scripts during an active gameplay session can temporarily break things.
</p>

<p>
   For example, imagine you play through two songs, then reload the <em>Scripts</em> folder from
   <em>ScreenSelectMusic</em>.  This screen may expect some working data in memory telling it how many songs have already
   been played, and that value may now be <code>nil</code>.  This could cause some theme code expecting a number
   to fail when it receives <em>nil</em>, and your theme will log errors.
</p>

<p>
   For this reason, I recommend only reloading Scripts from your theme's title screen.  Fully restarting StepMania also
   has the effect of loading all files from <em>Scripts</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="reload-theme-and-textures">Reload Theme and Textures</h2>
<p>
   First, hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>F6</kbd> to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into Theme debug mode.<br/>
   Then hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>6</kbd> to reload theme's cached textures.  "Cached textures" are typically any visual files loaded
   from the <em>Graphics</em> folder.
</p>

<p>
   After reloading your theme's cached textures, you'll need to <a href="#reload-current-screen">reload the current screen</a>
   to see any updated textures appear in your theme.
</p>

<h2 id="pull-back-camera">Pull Back the Camera</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>e</kbd> to pull StepMania's camera back.
   Use the same command again to zoom back in.
</p>

<p>
   <video controls>
      <source src="/Lua-For-SM5/img/pull-back-camera.mp4">
   </video>
 </p>

 <p>
   Pulling the camera back is a useful trick when you're working on
   using <a data-component="Link" href="/Theming/Simple-Tweens">tweens</a>
   to animate elements into view from offscreen, like the scrolling MusicWheel.
</p>

<p>
   You can see in the video above how the MusicWheel animates offscreen-right
   when the player presses <kbd>START</kbd> to enter the PlayerOptions menu.  And
   it animates back into view from offscreen-right when ScreenSelectMusic first draws.
</p>

<p>
   As a themer, being able to zoom out and see more than the player normally would can
   help you ensure <em>the thing you're animating is where it needs to be.</em>
</p>
