<h1>Keyboard Commands</h1>

<p>
   The StepMania engine provides some keyboard commands specifically to help
   creators.  Unless otherwise noted, these are globally available — they can
   be used at any time from any screen.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
   <strong>a note on Apple Keyboards</strong><br>
   If you're using an Apple keyboard on macOS (for example, the built-in keyboard
   on a MacBook), any commands that use <em>function</em> keys need to be
   also be combined with the <kbd>fn</kbd> key.<br><br>
   For example, to reload metrics.ini on Windows, Linux, or macOS-with-a-non-Apple-keyboard,
   you'd use <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>, but on macOS with an Apple keyboard, you'd use
   <kbd>fn</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>

<h2 id="reload-current-screen">Reload the Current Screen</h2>
<p>
   First, hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>F6</kbd> to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into <em>Theme</em> debug mode.<br>
   Then hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>2</kbd> to reload the current screen.
</p>

<p>
   You'll only need to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into <em>Theme</em> debug mode once.  Once that's
   toggled, you can directly use <kbd>F3</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> to reload the screen.
</p>

<p>
   When creating content for StepMania, you'll frequently make a change to Lua and then want to
   see how it looks in your theme.  For example, a png graphic displayed with
   <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/LoadActor">LoadActor</a> might appear on-screen too small,
   and you want to change its <a data-component="Link" href="/LuaAPI#Actors-Actor-zoom">zoom</a> from
   <code>1</code> to <code>1.5</code>
</p>
<p>
   To see if <code>1.5</code> is the zoom amount you want, you'll need to:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>edit your Lua file</li>
   <li>save your Lua file</li>
   <li>reload the screen with <kbd>F3</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd></li>
</ol>

<p>
   When the screen reloads, you'll see your new code take effect.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>This workflow of <em>edit → save → reload</em> is the most common one you'll use in StepMania theming.</strong>
</p>

<p>
   If you theme long enough, you'll develop muscle memory for <kbd>F3</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> and invoke
   it without thinking.  Eventually you'll try to use it on something unrelated like your Twitter feed,
   and momentarily wonder why it isn't working, and that will be your cue to take a break from
   StepMania theming.

<h2 id="reload-metrics">Reload Metrics.ini</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and tap <kbd>F2</kbd> reload the current theme's metrics.ini.
</p>

<h2 id="reload-scripts">Reload <em>Scripts</em> Folder</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>control</kbd> and tap <kbd>F2</kbd> reload the current theme's <em>Scripts</em>
   folder.
</p>

<hr />
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->




<h2 id="reload-theme-and-textures">Reload Theme and Textures</h2>
<p>
   First, hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>F6</kbd> to toggle your <em>Debug Menu</em> into Theme debug mode.<br/>
   Then hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>6</kbd> to reload theme's cached textures.
</p>

<h2 id="pull-back-camera">Pull Back the Camera</h2>
<p>
   Hold <kbd>F3</kbd> and tap <kbd>e</kbd> to pull StepMania's camera back.
   Use the same command again to zoom back in.
</p>

<p>

 </p>

 <p>
   Pulling the camera back is a useful trick when you're working on
   using <a data-component="Link" href="/Theming/Simple-Tweens">tweens</a>
   to animate elements into view from offscreen, like the scrolling MusicWheel.
</p>

<p>
   You can see in the video above how the MusicWheel animates offscreen-right
   when the player presses <kbd>START</kbd> to enter the PlayerOptions menu.  And
   it animates back into view from offscreen-right when ScreenSelectMusic first draws.
</p>

<p>
   As a themer, being able to zoom out and see more than the player normally would can
   help you ensure <em>the thing you're animating is where it needs to be.</em>
