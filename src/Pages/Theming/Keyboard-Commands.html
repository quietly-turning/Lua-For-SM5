 <p>
   Pulling the camera back is a useful trick when you're working on
   using <a data-component="Link" href="/Theming/Simple-Tweens">tweens</a>
   to animate elements into view from offscreen, like the scrolling MusicWheel.
</p>

<p>
   You can see in the video above how the MusicWheel animates offscreen-right
   when the player presses <kbd>START</kbd> to enter the PlayerOptions menu.  And
   it animates back into view from offscreen-right when ScreenSelectMusic first draws.
</p>

<p>
   As a themer, being able to zoom out and see more than the player normally would can
   help you ensure <em>the thing you're animating is where it needs to be.</em>
